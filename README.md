# discrete-pather

Just a little path planning coding quiz for Udacity CarND Term3.

As for how correct this implementation is, I am not sure. The Udacity checker API was somehow incompatible
with my code and I didn't bother to reverse engineer the problem. However, for all the (admittedly just a handful)
of test configurations I have tried, the code has produced correct results.

However, I have performed essentially no corner case testing or so. It is just a quizz, after all.

# discrete-pather, extension grid version

This relates to the next quiz, instructions in the Python source file.
