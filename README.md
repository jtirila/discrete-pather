# discrete-pather

Just some path planning coding quizzes for Udacity CarND Term3.

## Some notes concerning individual files
### discrete-pather
As for how correct this implementation is, I am not sure. The Udacity checker API was somehow incompatible
with my code and I didn't bother to reverse engineer the problem. However, for all the (admittedly just a handful)
of test configurations I have tried, the code has produced correct results.

However, I have performed essentially no corner case testing or so. It is just a quizz, after all.

### discrete-pather, extension grid version

Filename: `discrete-pather-track-extensions.py`

This relates to the next quiz, instructions in the Python source file.

### discrete-a-star.py

A simplified discrete search problem, solved by a simplified  `A*`
algorithm. (Not implemented yet.)
